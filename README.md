# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classical paper-and-pencil game for 2 players. 
we were used to play Tic-Tac-Toe game during 
our childhood. The rules are quite simple : 
each player sets a X or O on a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds 
in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
